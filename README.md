"Technical Report: A Comprehensive Comparison Between Quantifications of Nightingale Health's 1H-NMR Metabolomics Platform."
You can access the paper on https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38132863/.

## Background
Nightingale Health updated the quantification and calibration strategy of their 1H-NMR metabolomics platform in 2020 to better align the reported analytes with clinical standards. While these updates are intended to improve the quality and accuracy of the data, they may impact backward replicability and could potentially affect the comparison of repeated measures in longitudinal studies.

This study compares the Nightingale Health data originally released in 2014 or 2016 with the re-quantified version of this data released in 2020.
