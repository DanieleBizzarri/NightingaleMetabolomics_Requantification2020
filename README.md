# NightingaleMetabolomics_Requantification2020
This repository contains the code that can be used to reproduce the results shown in the project 'Technical report: A comprehensive comparison between quantificantions of Nightingale Healths' 1H-NMR mtabolopmics platform.
Nightingale Health has updated the quantification and calibration strategy of their platform in 2020 to further align their reported analytes with clinical standards. 
Such updates, however, might influence backward replicability and could hamper comparison of repeated measures in longitudinal studies.
Therefore we compared Nightingale data, originally released in 2014 or 2016, with a re-quantified version of this data released in 2020.
